/**
 * Base Account Data for users
 * Managed by Craig Terry
 *
 * Created models: Recipe, Tags, RecipeTags, and User models
 * Designed a unique tags implementation
 * - @see Tags identifies the category for each type of recipe and ingredient
 * - @see RecipeTags ties/associates recipes to tags and tags to recipes
 * Designing initial html (index.html)
 * Tags was designed to be more than id/tag name ... I spent the ramp up time configuring a 
 *    tag hierarchy that would provide a very flexible utility.
